# MunichQuantumArXivDiscordBot
A Discord Bot which fetches papers from arxiv from professors and research staff based in Munich.
Right now I execute the file in sequential order to get the message out however this is not ideal :D

Please make sure that you have a .env file where you list the Discord Server ID, the discord bot id and the channel ID.

It is not nice but it works. Feel free to update or alter the List of Professors to your needs.


Thanks to Arxiv.org for providing the API to get the papers!
Thanks Discord for the API to use the bot.


# TODO
create pipeline for only one execution
